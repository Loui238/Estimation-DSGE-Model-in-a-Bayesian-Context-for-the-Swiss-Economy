# Estimation-DSGE-Model-in-a-Bayesian-Context-for-the-Swiss-Economy

In the Seminar in Empirical Macroeconomics given by Luca Benati (University of Bern), I estimated a DSGE model for the Swiss economy in a Bayesian context. More  specifcally, I used a generalization of the Simple New Keynesian Model to allow for trending inflation. After transforming the set of equations into the Sims canonical form, I maximized the log poseterior and derived the ergodic distribution before simulating Impulse Response Functions and Forecast error Variances.
